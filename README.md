# Anomalous Financial Transactions

This project detects anomalous transactions in a dataset of financial transactions using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Built with scikit-learn, the Jupyter notebook is organized into sections covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Highlights

* Handled missing values and outliers
* Encoded categorical variables (gender, embarkation)
* Visualized data distributions, correlations, and feature importance
* Built and compared Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation
* Discussed insights and model limitations
