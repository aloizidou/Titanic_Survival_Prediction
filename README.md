# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Built with scikit-learn, the Jupyter notebook is organized into sections covering data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

## Highlights

* Handled missing values and outliers
* Encoded categorical variables (gender, embarkation)
* Visualized data distributions, correlations, and feature importance
* Built and compared Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers using accuracy, confusion matrices, and cross-validation
* Discussed insights and model limitations

## Notebook Structure

* **Introduction & Setup:** Overview and library imports
* **EDA:** Exploration of data distributions, missing values, and correlations
* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, encoding features
* **Model Building:** Training Decision Tree and Random Forest models
* **Evaluation:** Assessing models with metrics and visualizations
* **Discussion:** Insights, limitations, and possible improvements

## Next Steps

* Hyperparameter tuning
* Feature engineering (e.g., title extraction, family size)
* Exploring ensemble techniques
